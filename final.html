    <h1>Newton's Laws of Physics</h1>

    <h2>His First Law</h2>

    <div id="container_firstlaw">
        <p>"An object at rest stays at rest while an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force."</p>

        <p>In the real world, this basically is just stating that an object won’t move unless someone or something pushes it. Also when something does start moving, it will keep moving unless it is stopped.</p>

        <p>So in the end, an object will keep doing what it’s doing, unless somehow someone or something forces it to do something else. For example, a ball that is rolled across the floor at 5m/s will go on and on, unless you stop it, or it hits something like a wall.</p>

        <p>An unbalanced force needs to be exerted for the first law of motion to be seen. For example, you may buy an oversized soda from the gas station, and put it in the cup holder of your car. When you start the car, accelerate, and if the lid is off of the huge cup, you will see the soda start to rim out. This is because the soda wants to do what it was doing (staying still, and resting) but the motion of the car causes it to stir around.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>His Second Law</h2>

    <div id="container_secondlaw">
        <p>"The acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object."</p>

        <p>Basically its saying what happens when forces are unbalanced and moving. The real world version of that definition is just stating that how fast it moves depends on how big it is, and the acceleration.</p>

        <p>In math terms, how you find the net force is Fnet=m(a). So if a car weighs 17,000 kg, and its accelerating at 10m/s the it would look like this:</p>

        <p>Fnet=17,000kg(10m/s) Fnet=170,000
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>His Third Law</h2>

    <div id="container_thirdlaw">
        <p>"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."</p>

        <p>For example, when you are induced in rage and you hit the wall like a Super Saiyan, the wall is also a Super Saiyan and hits you back, causing your hand to hurt and forcing you to rethink your actions. There will always be two forces interacting with two pairs of objects, and the size of the force on the first object will always equal the second one.</p>

        <p>Another example could be when a bird flies. The wings push the air downwards, but the force of the air pushes it up. The first object is the air, and the second object is the air, and the two pair of forces are from the wing and the air.</p>

    <h1>What we did</h1>
    <p>Recently web and video game students came together with the the physics classrooms to create a website and animations based on physics in the real world. Our group decided to take on the challenge of finding the physics involved in one of the favorite activities for all ages - bowling.</p>

    <h1>What it shows</h1>
    <p>Bowling puts Newton’s first three laws into action as you roll the ball down the lane, and watch it as it strike the pins. A lot of things can be derived from just a game of bowling if you understand Newton's laws.</p>

    <h1>What's happening</h1>
    <p>As you roll the ball down the lane, Newton’s first law will be applied to the ball. As the ball is rolling down the lane, and striking the pins, you will see Newton’s second and Third law in action. Depending on how much the bowling ball weighs, and the speed it is going, you can figure out the force using some simple equations. All this will be introduced in detail on the next page.</p>
